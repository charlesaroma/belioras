        <p>
          This is the part most people are caught by. A 20&Prime; kinky wig and a 20&Prime; straight
          wig contain the same length of hair, but the kinky one will sit near the shoulder while the
          straight one reaches mid-back.

        <ul>
          <li>Measure from your hairline to where you want the hair to end.</li>
          <li>Add the allowance above for your texture.</li>
          <li>If you are between two lengths, take the longer — it can be cut, not added to.</li>
