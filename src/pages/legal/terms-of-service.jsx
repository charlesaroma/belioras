      </Section>

      <Section title="4. Orders and contract">
        <p>
          Clicking &ldquo;Place order&rdquo; makes a binding offer to buy. The contract is formed when

          refund anything you have paid.
        </p>

        <p>
          We ship to Germany, the European Union and selected international destinations. Delivery
          times on the site are estimates, not guarantees: some pieces are prepared after you order
          or ship from international locations. If there is a significant delay, we will tell you.

        <p>
          You may withdraw from your purchase within 14 days of receiving it, as set out in the
          withdrawal policy below and our <a href="/return-and-refund-policy">returns policy</a>.
          We do not offer direct exchanges: return the piece and place a new order.
        </p>
        <p>

          We are fully liable for intent and gross negligence, and for injury to life, body or health.
          Otherwise we are liable only for breaches of essential contractual duties, limited to the
          damage typical and foreseeable for this kind of contract. We are not responsible for delays
          caused by carriers, customs or payment providers beyond our control, or for damage from
