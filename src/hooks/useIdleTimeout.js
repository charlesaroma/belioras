 * with the backend — and it is what an admin actually experiences: an
 * unattended dashboard, on a laptop left open in a studio, does not stay
 * signed in indefinitely.
 *
 * A warning precedes the sign-out rather than replacing it. Expiring silently
 * mid-sentence in a product description is a good way to make people distrust
 * the tool; the draft dock keeps the work either way, but being told is the
 * difference between a policy and a bug.
 *
 * No state is written from the effect body: `schedule` only arms timers, and
 * `warning` is set by the timer or cleared by a real interaction, both of
 * which are outside render.
